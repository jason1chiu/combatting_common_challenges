        <h2>Challenges in Addressing Mental Health</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Teachers face a complex challenge in recognizing and addressing
            mental health issues, extending beyond their traditional educational
            roles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many teachers are not trained as mental health professionals, making
            it difficult to accurately identify and address these issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teachers must balance core teaching responsibilities with attending
            to students' mental well-being.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stigma and cultural differences in understanding mental illness can
            hinder open discussions and support for affected students.
